- Hungry Harry is a giant ogre with an appetite that fluctuates throughout the day. $H(t)$ models the weight of sheep (in $\text{kg}$ ) that Harry would like to swallow $t$ hours after he wakes up. Here, $t$ is entered in radians.
	- $H(t) = 12\sin\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{24}t\right) + 15$
	- What is the second time after Harry wakes up that he feels like consuming $17{\text{ kg}}$ of sheep?
	- *Round your final answer to the nearest tenth of an hour.*
	- ### Hints
	- ### Converting the problem into mathematical terms
	- $H(t) = 12\sin\left(\maroonD{\dfrac{2\pi}{24}}t\right) + 15$ has a period of $\dfrac{2\pi}{\maroonD{\scriptsize\dfrac{2\pi}{24}}}=24$ hours.
	- We want to find the **second** solution to the equation $H(t)=17$ within the period $0<t<24$ .
	- ### The answer
	- The equation's two solutions within the desired period (rounded to the nearest tenth of an hour) are $0.6$ and $11.4$ .
	- $\begin{aligned} 12\sin\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{24}t\right) + 15&=H(t) \\\\ 12\sin\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{24}t\right) + 15&=17 \\\\ 12\sin\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{24}t\right) &=2 \\\\ \sin\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{24}t\right) &=\dfrac{1}{6} \end{aligned}$
	- Rounding to several decimal places (in order to be precise), we get $\sin^{-1}\left(\dfrac{1}{6}\right)\approx 0.1674$ .
	- $\begin{aligned} {\dfrac{2\pi}{24}}t&=0.1674+2\pi n \\\\\\\\ t&={\dfrac{24}{2\pi}}\left(0.1674+2\pi n\right) \\\\\\\\ t&\approx 0.6+24n\end{aligned}$
	- Now, let's use the identity and $\sin(\theta)=\sin(\pi-\theta)$ to find the second expression for all possible values of $t$ .
	- $\begin{aligned} {\dfrac{2\pi}{24}}t&=\large(\normalsize\pi-0.1674\large)\normalsize+2\pi n \\\\\\\\ t&={\dfrac{24}{2\pi}}\left(\pi-0.1674+2\pi n\right) \\\\\\\\ t&\approx 11.4+24n\end{aligned}$
	- Therefore, the second time that Harry feels like consuming $17{\text{ kg}}$ of sheep after he wakes up is after $11.4$ hours.

	- Rounding to several decimal places (in order to be precise), we get $\cos^{-1}\left(\dfrac{0.5}{5}\right)\approx1.4706$ .
	- $\begin{aligned} \dfrac{2\pi}{3}t&=1.4706+2\pi n \\\\\\\\ t&={\dfrac{3}{2\pi}}\left(1.4706+2\pi n\right) \\\\\\\\ t&\approx 0.7+3n\end{aligned}$
	- Now, let's use the identity and $\cos(\theta)=\cos(2\pi-\theta)$ to find the second expression for all possible values of $t$ .
	- $\begin{aligned} {\dfrac{2\pi}{3}}t&=\large(\normalsize2\pi-1.4706\large)\normalsize+2\pi n \\\\\\\\ t&={\dfrac{3}{2\pi}}\left(2\pi-1.4706+2\pi n\right) \\\\\\\\ t&\approx 2.3+3n\end{aligned}$
	- Therefore, it takes about $0.7$ seconds for the boat to bob down to $-35\text{ cm}$ .

		- ​
		  for all integer values $n$ and radian values $\theta$ .
	- ### Converting the problem into mathematical terms
	- Since we're looking for a time when the distance is $380$ thousands of kilometers, we need to solve the following equation:
	- $\begin{aligned} Y(t)&=380 \\\\ -21\cos\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{29.5}t\right) + 384&=380 \end{aligned}$
	- We want to find the first solution to the equation which is greater than $0$ .
	- We will need to use cosine's identities to be sure that we've considered all the possible solutions in that range.
	- ### Solutions of the equation
	- Let's isolate the cosine expression:
	  $\cos\left({\dfrac{2\pi}{29.5}}t\right) =\dfrac{4}{21}$
	- Rounding to several decimal places (in order to be precise), we get $\cos^{-1}\left(\dfrac{4}{21}\right)\approx 1.379$ .
	- We remember that the cosine function is cyclical, so $\cos(\theta)=\cos(\theta+2\pi n)$ for all integer values of $n$ . Cosine is also even, so $\cos(\theta)=\cos(-\theta)$ . That means there is more than one solution to the equation.
	- $\begin{array}{rcl} \cos^{-1}\left( \cos\left({\dfrac{2\pi}{29.5}}t\right)\right) &= &\cos^{-1}\left( \dfrac{4}{21} \right)\\\\ \dfrac{2\pi}{29.5}t &\approx &1.379\\\\ \swarrow&&\searrow\\\\ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{2\pi}{29.5}t &\approx 1.379+2\pi n\\\\ t &\approx \dfrac{29.5}{2\pi}\left(1.379+2\pi n\right)\\\\ t &\approx 6+29.5n\\\\ t &\approx \ldots 6\text{, }35.5\text{, }65\ldots \end{aligned}&& \begin{aligned} \dfrac{2\pi}{29.5}t &\approx -1.379+2\pi n\\\\ t &\approx \dfrac{29.5}{2\pi}\left(-1.379+2\pi n\right)\\\\ t &\approx -6.5 +29.5n\\\\ t &\approx \ldots 23\text{, }52.5\text{, }82\ldots \end{aligned} \end{array}$
	- So the first positive solution within the desired period (rounded to the nearest whole day) is about $6$ and the second is about $23$ . We can also see that in the graph of $Y$ .

	- Since $-33<0$ , let's add $365$ to get a solution within the desired period: $-33+365=332$ .
	- Now, let's use the identity and $\sin(\theta)=\sin(\pi-\theta)$ to find the second expression for all possible values of $t$ $.

	- Now, let's use the identity and $\cos(\theta)=\cos(2\pi-\theta)$ to find the second expression for all possible values of $t$ .
	- $\begin{aligned} 2\pi t&=\large(\normalsize2\pi-1.2661\large)\normalsize+2\pi n \\\\\\\\ t&={\dfrac{1}{2\pi}}\left(2\pi-1.2661+2\pi n\right) \\\\\\\\ &\approx 0.80+1n\end{aligned}$ ​
